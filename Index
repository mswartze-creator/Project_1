<h2> Welcome! </h2>
<p> Welcome to the landing page for this portfolio! It is a work-in-progress for a portfolio website, which will eventually showcase artwork! I'm still working out a few of the bugs at this point, but I have high hopes! Currently, it is a site which presents a look back at my years at George Mason! </p>
