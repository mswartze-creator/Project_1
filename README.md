<h2> Welcome! </h2>
<p> Welcome to the landing page for this portfolio! It is a work-in-progress for a portfolio website, which will eventually showcase artwork! I'm still working out a few of the bugs at this point, but I have high hopes! Currently, it is a site which presents a look back at my years at George Mason! </p>

<p> I'm Rachelle Swartzentruber, and I'm working to graduate this semester from George Mason University with a major in English, Concentration in Professional Writing and Rhetoric. In my spare time, I paint and volunteer at my church, and have game nights with my friends when possible! <p>
